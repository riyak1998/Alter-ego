### Abstract:
Adolescence is a time of transition, where the individual is fuller of doubts than certainty. Amidst those situations what role does the education system play in creating holistic human beings and not just conflict-ridden or fragmented adults? Focusing on this issue, we tried to build a web application that could spread some light on importance of Adolescent education in schools, challenges faced by children, adolescents and even young adults studying in colleges and helping them in tackling those challenges with some sense, logic and responsibility with the help of advice provided by professional psychiatrists and counsellors. Also connecting help-seeking individuals anonymously with these professionals.

### Introduction and motivation:
Adolescence is a very special period of a person’s life where an individual assumes a sense of self-identity and is marked by a myriad of emotions including enthusiasm, idealism, self-doubt, and anxiety. It is a transitional phase between childhood and adulthood and is characterized by a number of physical, emotional, cognitive, intellectual and attitudinal changes. They see the challenges before them in fresh ways and are responding with enthusiasm and imagination. With the right investments, they can reach their full potential as individuals, leaders and agents of progress.  And the world clearly needs their energy, participation and skills. But delivering this transformation requires collective action on education, health, employment and a commitment to real civic engagement by diverse stakeholders including, Government Departments, academia, development partners and the society itself. 
But in the current situation, adolescents clearly lack that positive charisma and energy, which leads to wrong paths and decisions such as depression and in worst cases, suicide!

### Our Trek:
As a part of our trek for the HACKEAM'18, we decided to visit our respective schools to understand how the thinking of students in schools has changed now. Data collection was based on the conclusion of the small survey, workshop and a questionnaire round conducted by us in schools. Participants were students from 11-18 years of age group.

## Result:
Most adolescents with lifestyle issues fell in the age group of 16–18 years. Females were more depressed than males and had more sleep problems. Substance abuse and other addictions were documented more in males. Watching television or listening to music was stated as the most common late-night activity (61.8%) and therefore was also referred to as the contributory factor for less than eight hours of sleep each day. (58.9%) of the respondents are getting less than eight hours of sleep daily. (41.5%) of the respondents who felt depressed sought treatment for it. Quite a few of them were also indulged in substance abuse and other addictions. Only (16.8%) of the respondents opined that physical activity is essential for health. 25% of the respondents out of all were smoking cigarettes currently, whereas 7% of the respondents chewed paan (areca nut). Peer pressure was the most common reason (60%) to start smoking.

## Conclusion:
Inadequate sleep, depression and smoking were the leading unhealthy behaviors among the respondents. Problems in dealing with sudden puberty changes lead to self-consciousness, lack of confidence. Also adolescence is a time when many people first engage in sexual activity, potentially increasing their risk of unplanned pregnancy and unsafe abortion as well as of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. Families can play an important role to help these adolescents live a better healthier life. But something more needs to be done to address these issues urgently.

## Problem statement:
Adolescents need to be treated as a distinct segment of our population and it is important to realize and address their health and lifestyle problems. Immediate actions must be taken for a better future. Common issues such as depression, lack of confidence, peer pressure, drugs and alcoholism, puberty health problems, studies related issues, and premature and unprotected physical relationships, must be addressed with special care and proper knowledge. But not every individual is able to seek help from parents, counselors and psychiatrists. This leads to wrong decisions and in worst case self-destruction thoughts. 

## Solution proposed:
61% percent boys and 53% girls in the age group of 15-19 (National Sample Survey, 66th Round, 2013) are enrolled in schools and these numbers are likely to increase making schools important spaces for reaching out to adolescents. The power of technology could be used in an attempt of solving this issue. A web application could be built for students providing a platform where they could:
 * Read and learn about adolescent education 
 * Read about common issues faced by them and pieces of advice given by psychiatrists
 * Seek help by connecting directly with professional advisers and psychiatrists and discuss their problems without disclosing their identity
 * Learn healthy practices such as yoga and meditation which could improve their lifestyle
 * Seek for recovery and rehabilitation if they have abused drugs, smoking or have been involved in other such unhealthy practices
